                            <h4>Your Personal Information</h4>
                            <p>
                                We will use your personal information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We require identification verification for all accounts, this is to ensure we are fully compliant with the GHPC. We do this via LexisNexis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When you make an order with us for the first time we will use LexisNexis to verify your identity and that you are over 18.
                                This service will check the name, address and date of birth you provide against national registers to verify your information.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If this check is passed your order will continue to the next stage, but if not then we will ask for further proof of your identity.
                                In this case, we will request that you upload a photo of your ID, such as your passport or driver’s license, so our prescribing team can run checks of their own before approving or denying your order.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After verification, the copy of your ID will be deleted and will not be stored long-term.
                            </p> <br>

                            <p>
                                If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under our agreement, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
                            </p>
